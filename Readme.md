# Details about this project

Program that inputs two undirected graphs from the user and stores each graph in 3 different ways (representations) as explained in the example below.
- The program must display the edges of the graph 
- The program must be able to determine: The intersection between the graphs(common edges), The union of the graphs (all edges without repetition), whether one graph is a subgraph of another, the vertex (vertices) with the highest degree, whether the two graphs are equal (the same graph) or not

## The menu contains:

- Output graph A from the array of lists
- Output graph A from the matrix
- Output graph A from the array of structures/objects. 
- Output graph B from the array of lists
- Output graph B from the matrix
- Output graph B from the array of structures/objects.
- The intersection between both graphs
- The union of the two graphs
- Is graph (A) a subgraph of graph (B)?
- Is graph (B) a subgraph of graph (A)?
- Display the vertex (vertices) with the highest degree from graph A. 
- Display the vertex (vertices) with the highest degree from graph B. 
- Are the graphs equal (the same graph)?
- Exit program
